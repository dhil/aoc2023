# Advent of (Links) Code 2023

During December 2023 I will attempt to solve Advent of Code (version 2023) using the [Links programming language](https://links-lang.org). I will be using bleeding edge features of Links such as effect handlers, session types, and integrated database support to solve the exercises. I expect some rather obscure solutions, and who knows, maybe we will even encouter some bugs in the Links programming langauge.
